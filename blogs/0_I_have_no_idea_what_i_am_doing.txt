I have no idea what I am doing :)

That was a lie, I do actually have some idea, but definetly not the whole picture. On the surface level I am making a video game: It is piece of software that is intended for entertainment and artistic purposes, it has nice 3d graphics, it is controlled with a gamepad. But what it lacks (by purpose I should mention) is deep and meaningful gameplay. In this "game", you can grow trees, but you don't have to. You don't get any points or story progression or any gamelike rewards for doing so. There is a story in the game (one that I try my best to make deep and meaningful), but it is not affected by players actions at all. Its sort of like the tree growing businness is there only to keep you busy while story unfolds.

Story is super subtle and it is acceptable to me as a developer that people miss some things. Although on this as well I am not super sure. On one hand, it gives players more reasons to play the game again, on the other, this is kinda not nice way to do that.

Besides that, there is little else you can do.
