infinity simulator shooter
	- caveat: not quite "infinite"

	- Player starts with single gun, that they must fire manually and reload every now and then. Over time they get new guns, and ugrades to those guns that let them shoot faster, automatically, reload automatically etc. 

	- thing: they get to have all those gun simultaneously, never unwielding any gun
