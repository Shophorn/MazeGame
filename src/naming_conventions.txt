naming conventions

Types:
	PascalCase
	always use nouns

variables:
	camelCase
	also always use nouns

functions:
	sneaky_snake_case
	almost always use verbs:
		when function is merely a variable like accessor, may use nouns
	prefer non-member non-friend functions:
		again, variable like functions should be members

	eg.
	struct Example
	{
		int current;

		int next() { return current + 1; }
	};

	void reset_example(Example * example)
	{
		example->current = 0;
	}
