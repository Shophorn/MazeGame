long time ago, some race habitet the planet. the race was space travel capable
and eventually left the planet behind, having depleted the planets natural resources.
some time later, some other race appeared on the planet. they were vastly different,
like monsters to previous humanoid like creatures, and therefore had no need of any
infrasttructure left behind by previous inhabitants. as their number grew, they began
to clear things of the first race. as they evolved on the depleted planet, they had
no need for "nature" as it might be understood, instead preferring the barren desolate
wastes. one of the things they have not yet have removed, is a space elevator. somehow
they have understood its meaning, and any space travellers that land on the planet are
transported to its vicinity.

this is where game happens

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

goal is to power the space elevator. elevator uses natural energy from crystal trees that
player must grow. different areas in game can grow different colours of trees, and for
each of those areas player needs to grow a crystal tree. thing is, player does not know
which areas do what colour, and must grow other trees to find out. also, the crystal trees'
seeds are not easy to come by.
