Friend Simulator
	- go everywhere and give names to specific places
	- change the environment with plants

	- beware of the angery mountain
	- kingdom and king in west
	- dead robots "everywhere"
	- other kingdom in east

	- easterlings travel through valley to western kingdom for asylum etc.
	- player cannot pass, for they have no interkingdom passport

Where we are:
	- Rotated box colliders work, but character motors do not yet know
		how to handle non vertical collisions.


TREE THINGS
	Trees have roots, it is just a radius
	Roots determine size and capacity of water reservoir
	Dropping water on resevoir raises current wateriness level
	When wateriness is more zero, tree will use it to grow over time
	Growing decreases wateriness
	Bigger trees need more water to grow
	If wateriness is zero, tree will slowly start to die
	Trees grow at constant rate, but because bigger trees have bigger reserovoirs, they can manage longer without watering

	Mature trees produce seeds

	Water comes from clouds

	Trees grow differently in light and shadow, so meter lightness also

	Toxic soil? 

DONE:
	colliders compute transforms beforehand, only once per frame
