Friend Simulator
	- go everywhere and give names to specific places
	- change the environment with plants

	- beware of the angery mountain
	- kingdom and king in west
	- dead robots "everywhere"
	- other kingdom in east

	- easterlings travel through valley to western kingdom for asylum etc.
	- player cannot pass, for they have no interkingdom passport

Where we are:
	- Rotated box colliders work, but character motors do not yet know
		how to handle non vertical collisions.


TREE THINGS
	Trees have roots, it is just a radius
	Roots determine size and capacity of water reservoir
	Dropping water on resevoir raises current wateriness level
	When wateriness is more zero, tree will use it to grow over time
	Growing decreases wateriness
	Bigger trees need more water to grow
	If wateriness is zero, tree will slowly start to die
	Trees grow at constant rate, but because bigger trees have bigger reserovoirs, they can manage longer without watering

	Mature trees produce seeds

	Water comes from clouds

	Trees grow differently in light and shadow, so meter lightness also

	Toxic soil? 

DONE:
	colliders compute transforms beforehand, only once per frame	
	full terrain coverage
	toggle debug shadow texture

TODO:
	non-generic shader code for main shader
	non-generic shader code for other shaders

	Gui draw only texture


	Shadows
		Separate player camera and free camera, so we can visualize view frustum


	Gui screen scale in game code
	Gui draw texture
	Vulkan expose shadow texture

	Vulkan explicit shader structs for each pipeline, like ThinMatrix does
	

	Editor: teleport player

	New tree rules
	Falling objects
	Pickup animation
	Clouds and rain

	Better shadows

	planet curvature shader

	procedural sky
	animated sun
	daytime

	multiple collisions

	fox suit?
	bird suit

	fox npc:s
	bird npc:s

	Angery mountain
	Flying building with eternal shadow
	underground cavern with water pump that can pump water and form a pond to under the flying building

NAMES:
	Feral Gallery?
	Pehvreiwjfpi Gallery?
