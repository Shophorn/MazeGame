Friend Simulator
	- go everywhere and give names to specific places
	- change the environment with plants

	- beware of the angery mountain
	- kingdom and king in west
	- dead robots "everywhere"
	- other kingdom in east

	- easterlings travel through valley to western kingdom for asylum etc.
	- player cannot pass, for they have no interkingdom passport

Where we are:
	- Rotated box colliders work, but character motors do not yet know
		how to handle non vertical collisions.


TREE THINGS
	Trees have roots, it is just a radius
	Roots determine size and capacity of water reservoir
	Dropping water on resevoir raises current wateriness level
	When wateriness is more zero, tree will use it to grow over time
	Growing decreases wateriness
	Bigger trees need more water to grow
	If wateriness is zero, tree will slowly start to die
	Trees grow at constant rate, but because bigger trees have bigger reserovoirs, they can manage longer without watering

	Mature trees produce seeds

	Water comes from clouds

	Trees grow differently in light and shadow, so meter lightness also

	Toxic soil? 

DONE:
	colliders compute transforms beforehand, only once per frame	
	full terrain coverage
	toggle debug shadow texture
	Gui screen scale in game code
	
	28.5:
	Separate player camera and free camera
	remove game initializable shadow pipeline

	29.5:
	Thing:
		Vulkan explicit shader structs for each pipeline, like ThinMatrix does
		non-generic shader code for main shader
		non-generic shader code for other shaders

		Gui draw only texture
		Vulkan expose shadow texture
		Gui draw texture
	chalk pyramid cube thing
	Separate player debug levels
	vertical collision rays

	30.5:
	Editor: teleport player
	No input for player when menu is open
	remove middle elements from scene

	31.5:
	chunked terrain for increased resolution
	Normal mapping



DOING:

TODO:
	Track vulkan memory like memoryarena
	toggle shadows in game

	fix ground and character normals

	Gui:
		pivot control
		panel widget

	Specular shading

	STREAM: New tree rules
	STREAM: Animate robot

	proper pickuping, as in pickup from front only and closet item always, not first in array
	cylinder colliders

	Shadows
		Visualize camera frustums so we can visualize view frustum
		Better shadows

	Falling objects
	Pickup animation
	Clouds and rain
	foliage and rocks
	journey sand

	terrain lod meshes
	chunked heightmap for faster collisions


	planet curvature shader

	character collisions with volumes

	procedural sky
	animated sun
	daytime

	multiple collisions

	fox suit?
	bird suit

	fox npc:s
	bird npc:s

	Angery mountain
	Flying building with eternal shadow
	underground cavern with water pump that can pump water and form a pond to under the flying building
	chalk pyramid

	"Simulation space ends here" signs at both ends

	marching cubes/voxel terrain

	Gear 2:
		Separate animation from motor, and only animate visible models
		Lower collision detection accuracy for models far away
		Overall cull stuff :)
