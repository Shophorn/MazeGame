Story Time:

Player is a gardener like character, who is 'trapped' on a particular island. Trapped as in, there exists a active train connection
to somewhere, but player has no way to get a ticket.

There is another character at the island, the Noble, who has a villa of sort there as their personal resort suite. At the beginning,
the noble will hang around at the island for a while, and it may be so that the player may interact with them. (Maybe they even show
the player how to climb the trees and collect fruits to plant more trees.) After some time though, war rises from horizon, and the
Noble leaves the island. For the better part of the games duration, war rages on, and the Noble will visit the island from time to
time. In the end, war ends and they will return for good(, transformed by the horrors somehow). 

During the war, particularly in the absence of the Noble, player has little to do except to explore the sparse mysteries of the barren
island, and grow trees( and maybe other plants too). There is the train station, where player will be denied entrance each time, since
they do not have a train ticket. Player and the Noble will probably create some kind of relationship during the Nobles visit, maybe they
bring some exotic seeds to player from their travels. Or accessories.

State of the war will be shown in the sky, horizons turning red etc.

The train will come once a 'year', or time it takes any plants to grow some amount. There are only one track, and each time train will
go to other direction. Many times the train will come empty, so that the couple times the Noble does come, will feel more important.
The train will only stop on station if player is there, but player will still be denied access.

Non evergreen plants will drop their leaves, and grow some more next 'year'. Mature plants will produce fruit.
