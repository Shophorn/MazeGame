Warlock woman on island is in isolation for sorrow. Her family(husband and some kids) died in accident a long time ago, and it may have been her fault. They are buried on that island. She is studying something that is related to that accident (no necromancy though). She is super powerful and her hunger for arcane arts is immense.

Train and floating house works on her power.
