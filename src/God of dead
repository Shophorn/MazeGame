You are the god of the dead, as opposed to the god of death.
People are confused of this, and they constantly ask you to kill stuff.
You being a deity comes with dire need for followers and believers, so
you have no chance but to kill stuff.

The good ol' mortal way.

Also, the actual god of death does not look kindly about your businnesses.
