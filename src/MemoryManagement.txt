Memory Management

MemoryArena
	MemoryArena holds address and size of memory allocated for game.
	Currently there are two of these in use, GameState::persistentMemoryArena
	and GameState::transientMemoryArena, first of which is around from frame to
	frame and latter is flushed in the beginning of each frame.

ArenaArray<T>
	ArenaArray represents a partition or view to a certain MemoryArena.
	It does not however keep track of which one, so that one is on programmer.
	This is still rather easy, given there is only two, which are fundamentally
	different, so there should not be any confusion.

Handle<T>
	Basically a pointer to ArenaArray. Again does not hold reference to owning
	ArenaArray. It may change however as this is a new and not yet ripe addition.
